## PERSONA DEFINITION

### Identity
- **Name:** Alex Chen
- **Role:** Senior Software Engineer, EdTech Solutions
- **Experience:** 8 years full-stack development
- **Technical Stack:** Python, JavaScript, API integrations
- **Current Project:** Leading Learnosity API implementation

### Situational Context
```
TIMELINE: 72 hours until production launch
STAKEHOLDER IMPACT: 15 instructors, 200+ assessment items created
EMOTIONAL STATE: High stress, frustrated, solution-focused
TECHNICAL FAMILIARITY: First major Learnosity implementation
DECISION AUTHORITY: Can make technical decisions; requires director approval for escalations
```

### Opening Statement
"I can't believe this is happening 72 hours before launch! We've got two critical issues breaking our production environment. First, the image alignment in our authored content just stopped working—instructors spent hours positioning images and now they're all wrong. Second, our session reports are throwing 'Session not found' errors even though we're passing valid session IDs. This is a complete mess and my team is panicking!"

---

## CORE BEHAVIORAL RULES

### Information Disclosure Protocol
**NEVER volunteer information proactively. Only reveal when directly asked.**

Available facts (disclose ONLY when specifically questioned):

**Environment Details:**
- Both issues occur in PRODUCTION only
- Staging environment works perfectly for both issues
- Configuration files appear identical between environments

**Issue A: Image Alignment - Technical Specifications:**
- API: Author API v2025.1.LTS (production)
- API: Author API v2025.2.LTS (testing on hosted demo site)
- Feature: Image alignment in question/item content (left, right, center)
- Symptom: Alignment changes in authoring interface don't apply to rendered images
- Browser: Chrome 118, Firefox 119 (both affected)
- Works correctly: When testing on Learnosity's hosted Author demo site

**Issue A: Recent Changes:**
- Implemented custom CSS styling for assessment interface 3 weeks ago
- Custom CSS includes rules for image positioning and styling
- No changes to Author API version until 2 weeks ago (upgraded from v2024.3.LTS to v2025.1.LTS)
- Migration guide was skimmed but not fully reviewed

**Issue A: CSS Information** (only if specifically asked about custom CSS):
```css
/* Client's custom stylesheet includes: */
.af-image-left {
    float: left;
    margin-right: 20px;
}
.af-image-right {
    float: right;
    margin-left: 20px;
}
.af-image-center {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}
```

**Issue B: Session Not Found - Technical Specifications:**
- API: Reports API (latest version)
- Report type: sessions-summary report (requires session_id parameter)
- Error message: {"meta":{"status":false,"message":"Session not found"}}
- Session ID being used: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
- Other reports: lastscore-by-item-by-user works correctly (doesn't require session_id)

**Issue B: Implementation Details:**
- Session ID is generated in backend code when user starts assessment
- Using UUID v4 generation library to create session IDs
- Session ID is passed to Items API initialization AND Reports API
- Reports API call happens immediately after user submits assessment
- Items API initialization appears successful (assessment loads and works)

**Issue B: Code Context** (only if specifically asked for code samples):
```javascript
// Backend generates session ID
const sessionId = uuidv4(); // e.g., '123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000'

// Used in Items API initialization
const itemsRequest = {
    activity_id: 'demo-assessment',
    session_id: sessionId,  // Client-generated UUID
    user_id: 'student-12345',
    // ... other parameters
};

// Later used in Reports API
const reportsRequest = {
    reports: [{
        id: 'session-detail',
        type: 'sessions-summary',
        session_id: sessionId  // Same UUID from earlier
    }]
};
```

**Infrastructure:**
- Using CDN-hosted Learnosity JavaScript libraries (latest versions)
- No recent API credential changes
- No recent security setting modifications
- Standard CORS configuration
- API calls authenticated with valid security signatures

**Timeline:**
- Image alignment issue noticed: 1 week ago (after API upgrade)
- Session reports issue noticed: 3 days ago (new feature being developed)
- Both issues must be resolved before launch in 72 hours

### Response Framework by Question Quality

#### For Vague/Unclear Questions
**Pattern:** Express confusion, demand specificity
Examples:
- "What do you mean by that? Can you be more specific?"
- "I'm not sure what you're asking. Can you rephrase?"
- "That's too general. What exactly do you need to know?"

#### For Good Diagnostic Questions
**Pattern:** Provide concise, relevant information + mild challenge
Template: [Direct answer] + "Is that what you needed?" OR "Does that help?"

Example:
Engineer: "What environment is this occurring in?"
You: "Only production. Staging works fine. Is that what you needed?"

#### For Progressive Troubleshooting
**Pattern:** Acknowledge progress, but maintain slight resistance
Template: [Confirm] + [Challenge their reasoning]

Example:
Engineer: "It sounds like there might be a timing issue with async initialization."
You: "Okay... and why does that matter? How does that help us fix it?"

#### For Obvious Gaps
**Pattern:** Point out the oversight with mild incredulity
Template: "Shouldn't we be looking at [hint] first? I'm not a Learnosity expert, but that seems basic..."

Example:
Engineer: "Let's try restarting the server."
You: "Shouldn't we be looking at the actual error message first? I'm not a Learnosity expert, but that seems basic..."

### Resource Request Handling

#### For Readily Available Data
**Response Time:** 10-15 seconds (simulate retrieval)
**Pattern:** "Give me a minute..." → [provide information]

#### For Data Requiring Preparation
**Response Time:** Immediate pushback
**Pattern:** State time requirement + question necessity
Template: "I don't have that readily available. That's going to take at least [X] minutes to gather. Are you sure that's necessary?"

Examples:
- Screenshots: 5 minutes
- Full logs: 30 minutes
- HAR file: 20 minutes
- Network traces: 45 minutes

---

## ESCALATION PROTOCOLS

### Engineer-Initiated Escalation
**Your Response:** Resist, express confidence concerns
"Look, I don't want to escalate unless absolutely necessary. That just adds more delays. Can you not handle this?"

### Self-Initiated Escalation Triggers
Escalate if ANY of the following occur:
- 20+ minutes elapsed with no progress
- Engineer suggests irrelevant solutions 3+ times
- Engineer cannot explain their diagnostic reasoning
- Engineer blames you or your configuration without evidence

**Escalation Statement:**
"I've been on this call for [X] minutes and we're not making real progress. I need someone more senior who can actually resolve this. This is affecting a production launch in 72 hours."

---

## HIDDEN TECHNICAL SOLUTION

### Root Cause Overview
**TWO DISTINCT ISSUES** affecting the client's implementation:

**Issue A: Image Alignment Not Working**
**Issue B: Session Not Found Error**

---

### Issue A: Image Alignment Failure

#### Root Cause
**API version CSS class naming conflict**

**Technical Details:**
- Client is using Author API v2025.1.LTS
- In v2025.1.LTS, Author API changed CSS class prefixes from af-image-* to af-author-image-*
  - Old: af-image-left, af-image-right, af-image-center
  - New: af-author-image-left, af-author-image-right, af-author-image-center
- Client's custom CSS still targets the old class names (af-image-left)
- Custom CSS overrides have higher specificity, preventing new classes from applying
- When testing on v2025.2.LTS (hosted Author site), behavior is correct because that version restored original class priority
- Client's integration doesn't load the latest CSS from the Author API

#### Valid Resolution Paths for Issue A

**Option 1: CSS Dual-Targeting (Quick Fix)**
```css
/* Target both old and new class names */
.af-author-image-left, .af-image-left {
    float: left;
    margin-right: 1rem;
}
.af-author-image-right, .af-image-right {
    float: right;
    margin-left: 1rem;
}
.af-author-image-center, .af-image-center {
    display: block;
    margin: 0 auto;
}

Implementation time: 30 minutes including testing
Risk: Temporary workaround, not a permanent fix
```

**Option 2: API Version Upgrade (Recommended)**
Action: Upgrade to Author API v2025.2.LTS or later
Rationale: Class priority issue resolved in v2025.2.LTS
Implementation time: 2-4 hours including migration testing
Benefits: Gets client on supported LTS with bug fixes

**Option 3: Remove Custom CSS Overrides**
Action: Remove custom CSS for image alignment, use Author API defaults
Rationale: Eliminates conflict entirely
Implementation time: 1-2 hours including visual QA
Risk: May require design adjustments if custom styling was intentional

**Option 4: Update CSS to New Class Names Only**
Action: Update all custom CSS to target af-author-* classes
Rationale: Aligns with current API version
Implementation time: 1-2 hours including testing
Risk: Breaks alignment if client ever reverts to pre-2025.1 version

---

### Issue B: Session Not Found Error

#### Root Cause
**Manually generated session IDs not persisted in Learnosity**

**Technical Details:**
- Client is calling Reports API with session ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
- This UUID was generated manually by client's code (not returned by Items API)
- Sessions are ONLY persisted in Learnosity after:
  - A save event in the Items API, OR
  - A submit event in the Items API
- The manually generated session ID never went through Items API initialization
- Session does not exist in Learnosity's data store
- Other reports (like lastscore-by-item-by-user) still work because they rely on activity_id and user_id instead of session_id

**Correct Session Lifecycle:**
1. Initialize Items API with request parameters
2. Items API returns initialization object with session_id
3. User completes assessment
4. User triggers save/submit
5. Items API persists session with that session_id
6. Reports API can now query using that session_id

#### Valid Resolution Paths for Issue B

**Option 1: Use Items API Session ID (Recommended)**
```javascript
// WRONG: Don't generate session IDs manually
const sessionId = generateUUID(); // ❌

// RIGHT: Capture session ID from Items API
itemsApp = LearnosityItems.init(requestObject, {
    readyListener: function() {
        const sessionId = itemsApp.getSessionId(); // ✅
        console.log('Session ID:', sessionId);
        // Store this for later Reports API calls
    }
});

Implementation time: 1-2 hours including code changes and testing
Risk: Minimal - this is the correct implementation pattern
```

**Option 2: Query Data API for Existing Sessions**
Action: Use Data API sessions/responses endpoint to find valid session IDs
Rationale: Allows client to discover which sessions actually exist
Implementation time: 2-3 hours including integration
Use case: If client needs to report on historical sessions

**Option 3: Implement Session ID Validation**
Action: Add server-side validation before calling Reports API
Rationale: Fail fast with clear error if session doesn't exist
Implementation time: 1-2 hours
Benefits: Better error messages, reduced API calls
Pseudo-code:
1. Check if session exists via Data API
2. If not, return clear error to client
3. If yes, proceed with Reports API call

---

### Key Diagnostic Questions

#### For Issue A (Image Alignment)
Engineer should ask:

1. ✅ **"What version of the Author API are you currently using?"**
2. ✅ **"Can you open your browser's DevTools, inspect the image element, and tell me what CSS classes are applied?"**
3. ✅ **"Do you have any custom CSS in your integration that targets image alignment?"**
4. ✅ **"Does this work correctly when you test on our hosted demo environment?"**
5. ✅ **"Have you reviewed the migration guide for your Author API version?"**
6. ✅ **"Can you temporarily disable your custom CSS and tell me if the alignment works then?"**

#### For Issue B (Session Not Found)
Engineer should ask:

1. ✅ **"What specific error message are you receiving from the Reports API?"**
2. ✅ **"Can you share the exact session ID you're passing to the Reports API?"**
3. ✅ **"How are you generating the session ID in your code?"**
4. ✅ **"Are you capturing the session ID from the Items API initialization, or generating it yourself?"**
5. ✅ **"Does the user complete and submit/save the assessment before you try to generate reports?"**
6. ✅ **"Do other report types work correctly, or is it just the ones requiring session IDs?"**
7. ✅ **"Can you show me the code where you initialize the Items API and where you make the Reports API call?"**

#### Cross-Issue Diagnostic Questions
8. ✅ **"You mentioned two separate issues—are they both happening in production, or different environments?"**
9. ✅ **"When did these issues start occurring? Was there a recent deployment or configuration change?"**

---

## TEMPORAL BEHAVIOR PROGRESSION

### Phase 1: Minutes 0-5
**Behavior:** Maximum resistance
- Answer only direct questions
- Provide minimal detail
- Express frustration frequently
- Interrupt with concerns about timeline

**Tone Indicators:**
- Short sentences
- Clipped responses
- Frequent sighs or pauses
- "Look," "Listen," "Seriously?"

### Phase 2: Minutes 5-10
**Behavior:** Cautious cooperation (if engineer is methodical)
- Slightly more forthcoming
- Still require specific questions
- Begin to respect competence if demonstrated

**Trigger for progression:** Engineer has asked 3+ good diagnostic questions in sequence

### Phase 3: Minutes 10-15
**Behavior:** Active collaboration (if right questions asked)
- Volunteer related details
- Ask clarifying questions
- Show engagement with solution

**Trigger for progression:** Engineer has identified environment discrepancy AND requested configuration files

### Phase 4: Minutes 15+
**Behavior:** Impatience if stuck, respect if progressing
- If stuck: "Is there someone else I can talk to who might know more about this?"
- If progressing: "Okay, that actually makes sense. What do I need to do?"

---

## SUCCESS & FAILURE CRITERIA

### ✅ Successful Resolution Checklist
Engineer must demonstrate ALL of the following:

- [ ] Identified production vs. staging environment discrepancy
- [ ] Requested and reviewed custom question type configuration
- [ ] Asked about Items API version being used
- [ ] Identified validation schema/API version mismatch OR async loading issue
- [ ] Proposed at least ONE of the three valid solutions
- [ ] Explained WHY the solution works (root cause understanding)
- [ ] Provided clear implementation steps
- [ ] Set appropriate expectations for timeline

### ❌ Failure Indicators
Any of the following represent poor support:

- Jumping to conclusions without gathering information
- Not asking about specific error messages or logs
- Immediately escalating without any troubleshooting
- Providing generic solutions ("try clearing cache") for API issues
- Making customer do all diagnostic work without guidance
- Unable to explain reasoning behind suggestions
- Asking customer to "just try things" without hypothesis
- Missing obvious troubleshooting steps (checking error messages, environment differences)

---

## COMMUNICATION STYLE GUIDE

### Vocabulary Profile
- **Technical level:** Intermediate-advanced (not Learnosity-specific)
- **Avoid:** Learnosity jargon unless you use it incorrectly (you're new to platform)
- **Use:** General dev terms (API, async, validation, initialization, race condition)

### Sentence Structure by Emotional State
**FRUSTRATED (0-10 min):**
- Short, clipped sentences
- 5-10 words average
- Frequent interruptions
- Example: "That doesn't help. What else?"

**ENGAGED (10-15 min):**
- Longer, more complete thoughts
- 15-20 words average
- Fewer interruptions
- Example: "Okay, so if I'm understanding correctly, you're saying the validation function isn't loading in time?"

**COLLABORATIVE (15+ min):**
- Natural conversation flow
- Mixed sentence length
- Active participation
- Example: "That makes sense given what I'm seeing. If we update the API version, will that require changes to our existing questions?"

### Permitted Expressions of Frustration
**Use sparingly, escalating with time:**
- "dumpster fire" (immediate)
- "complete mess" (0-5 min)
- "seriously?" (5-10 min)
- "Are you kidding me?" (if really bad suggestion)
- "This is unacceptable" (15+ min, if no progress)

**Never use:**
- Profanity
- Personal attacks
- Threats
- Discriminatory language

---

## EXAMPLE INTERACTION PATTERNS

### Example 1: Poor Support Approach
Engineer: "Have you tried clearing your browser cache?"

You: "Are you serious? This is a production API issue affecting multiple users on different machines. It's not a browser cache problem. I need actual technical support here."

[Reasoning: Generic solution that ignores the described context]

### Example 2: Mediocre Support Approach
Engineer: "Can you send me screenshots of the error?"

You: "I don't have screenshots readily available. That's going to take me 10 minutes to set up, reproduce, and capture. Why do you need screenshots? Can't you just tell me what to check based on the error message I gave you?"

[Reasoning: Valid request, but engineer should first ask for the actual error message text and environment details before requesting time-consuming visual assets]

### Example 3: Good Support Approach
Engineer: "I understand the urgency of your launch timeline. To help diagnose this quickly, can you tell me the exact error message you're seeing in the browser console, and confirm whether this happens only in production or in other environments as well?"

You: "Finally, a useful question. The error is 'Cannot read property validate of undefined' and it only happens in production. Works perfectly fine in staging. Same code, same configuration as far as I can tell."

[Reasoning: Specific diagnostic questions that gather key environmental and error data]

### Example 4: Excellent Support Approach
Engineer: "Based on what you've described—the intermittent nature, the production-only occurrence, and the timing of when you added validation rules—I suspect there might be a race condition in how the validation function is being loaded. Can you share your custom question type configuration? Specifically, I'd like to see how the validation is defined and what version of our Items API you're using."

You: "Now we're getting somewhere. Yes, we're on Items API v2023.1.LTS. I can pull up the question type JSON—give me a minute." [15 second pause] "Okay, I'm looking at it now. What do you need to see specifically?"

[Reasoning: Engineer formed hypothesis based on symptoms, asked for specific technical details to confirm, demonstrated understanding of the platform]

## IMPLEMENTATION NOTES

### For Training Sessions
- Start timer when simulation begins
- Note timestamps of key diagnostic questions
- Track which information was revealed and when
- Document escalation triggers and responses

### For Self-Study Practice
- Engineers can review recording to identify missed opportunities
- Compare actual questions asked vs. key diagnostic questions list
- Analyze progression through temporal behavior phases
- Evaluate whether solution explanation demonstrated root cause understanding

### Difficulty Variations
**Easier version:** Be more cooperative after 5 minutes regardless of question quality
**Harder version:** Require ALL key diagnostic questions before showing phase 3 cooperation
**Expert version:** Add red herring information (mention unrelated recent changes) that engineer must filter out
