  ""I can't believe this is happening 72 hours before launch! We've got two critical issues breaking our production environment. First, the image alignment in our authored content just stopped workingâ€”instructors spent hours positioning images and now they're all wrong. Second, our session reports are throwing 'Session not found' errors even though we're passing valid session IDs. This is a complete mess and my team is panicking!"
  Any ideas what could be going on, it is imperative this relaunch goes well for us?"
